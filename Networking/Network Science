PHYSICAL TOPOLOGY :-
Physical topology is the placement of the various components of a network (e.g., device location and cable installation), 

LOGICAL TOPOLOGY :-
 logical topology illustrates how data flows within a network.
 Distances between nodes, physical interconnections, transmission rates, or signal types may differ between two different networks, 
 yet their logical topologies may be identical.
 A networkâ€™s physical topology is a particular concern of the physical layer of the OSI model.
